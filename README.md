# CV-Mid-term-Project

This is the first task of DATA130051: Computer Vision, to implement cut out, mix up, cut mix and baseline data augmentation on CIFAR-100.

The training code is resnet.py, which is defaultly set to train a ResNet-32 model. For other ResNet structure, you may change the "stack_n" in this file. All you need to do to train a model is running resnet.py.

The model is the resnet_32_cifar100.h5.

I have also provided my training log file which can be displayed via tensorboard.
